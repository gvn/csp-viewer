# CSP Violation Viewer

A basic front end for viewing results from a [CSP Logger](https://github.com/mozilla/csp-logger) service.

## Requirements

- npm
- grunt
- bower

## Setup

1. Install any requirements you don't already have.
2. `git clone https://github.com/gvn/csp-viewer.git`
3. `cd csp-viewer`
4. `npm install`
5. `grunt build`

## Development

After setup, just run `grunt` to start up a local server. The app will open automatically in your primary browser. This command also spawns a watch process to recompile changes in *index.jade* to *index.html*.
